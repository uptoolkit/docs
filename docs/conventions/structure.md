# Structure

Structuring a project is a very an import part of any project. We use a dogmatic approach that we see the most and based on Next.Js/Laravel conventions : 

For the front-end : 

- components : a folder where you put your components every 
- layouts : a folder where you put your layouts
- pages : a folder where you put your pages
- public : public folder where you typically put your assets

For the back-end : 
- /api/me : should return the user logged
- /api/csrf-token : should return a csrf token used for a session
- /
