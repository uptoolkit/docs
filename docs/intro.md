# Getting started

Let's discover **The Uptoolkit in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Using our templates

You can use one of our boilerplate to start your project.

- Modern Monolith approach (everything in the same repository) : 
  - Laravel + Tailwind + Inertia (React/Vue) 
  - Next.js + Express + Prisma
  - Adonis.js
  - Django
- Jam Stack approach (front-end/back-end are splitted) : 
  - Back-End : 
    - Express + Prisma
    - Upback Nest.js
    - Upback Adonis
    - Upback Laravel
    - Django
  - Front-End :
    - Next.js
    - Nuxt.js
  - CMS : 
    - Strapi
    - Wordpress
  - Electron App : 
    - Electron + Next.js + Tailwind

## Start your app

Most of the projects have the same modus operandi :

```bash
cd my-website
npm install
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
